    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets start from the begining. and I mean the very begining. \n",
    "\n",
    "What is the world? \n",
    "\n",
    "If you think about it, we can very safely say that the world consists entirely of OBJECTS and of ACTIONS. \n",
    "\n",
    "The world we live in seems to have two main features: space and time. \n",
    "\n",
    "OBJECTS are what we primarily associate with SPACE, because an object has to occupy some space. \n",
    "\n",
    "ACTIONS on the other hand, we asocited primarily with TIME. Its impossible to think about actions without time, because actions always seem to have a start, finish and some change that they bring about. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, OBJECTS and ACTIONS are deeply interelated. OBJECTS can perform actions, and actions can be performed on objects. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is the reason why the most basic building blocks of any human language are Nouns and Verbs, because pretty much everything that we can talk about involve things and actions. \n",
    "\n",
    "For thousands of years, humans recorded and communicated the knowledge that they gathered about the world using physical writing. Pens and paper etc. With this ability humans were able to change the world around them in ways no other living being has been to.\n",
    "\n",
    "Astronomers were able to describe the positions and movements of the stars and write down their observations. These writings helped travelers navigate long voyages over land and sea and allowed them to access and transport resources and ideas they would not have been able to otherwise. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you had a business you would write down what you sold and for how much in some kind of book or ledger. Then at the end of the week or month, you would open your book and go down the list and add up the sales to see how much money you made. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now lets talk about computers. \n",
    "\n",
    "The problem with writing is that it is static. You can only read back whatever you wrote in, and for thousands of years people were restricted to this system. What made computers a revolution in human technology is that they have the ability to produce output that is different from the input that they are given. This opens up a whole universe of possibilities for describing, understanding and affecting the world around us. \n",
    "\n",
    "So if we go back to the example of a business ledger, the output from a written ledger is whatever you input into the ledger to write with. And all the additions, calculations and manipulations have to be done by the person reading the ledger. However, if you enter that sales information into a computer, it has the ability to return the sum or avergae or percentage metrics relate to that sales information. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now in order for a computer to know what kind of output to produce for  given input, it needs to be given instructions on how to handle that input. And this is the purpose of all programming languages; they are simply a way for us tell computers what to do in a given set of situations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python is one such programming language. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let us now see how we can use Python to make computers do what we want them to do and change the world. "
